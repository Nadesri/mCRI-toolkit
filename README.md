A GitHub Repository for: qMT

A mini toolkit of MATLAB functions and scripts to process qMT images based on the modified Cross Relaxation Imaging (mCRI) model

This is a collection of tools for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging using MRI SPGR images. These tools are based on Pouria Mossahebi's modified Cross Relaxation Imaging (mCRI) model, which is based from Vasily Yarnykh's Cross Relaxation Imaging (CRI) model. These functions are slight modifications of the mCRI fit or  analysis tools related to the mCRI fit. 

A couple of these files are scripts. These were originally authored by Nade to automate the workflow for qMT image processing. Please refer to Instructions.txt to get some insights about how to run these scripts.

In full disclosure, Pouria Mossahebi also collaborated with Alexey Samsonov and Sam Hurley to publish an open-source MATLAB package of quantative MRI functions. This package can be found here: http://medphysics.wisc.edu/~samsonov/qmap/
